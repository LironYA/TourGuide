The Reef is home to a colorful array of tropical fish, beautiful coral and, most significantly, a school of bottle-nosed dolphins including babies born on the site.  It was established over twenty years ago with the vision of bringing humans closer to animals in a sensitive and respectful way.  The dolphins are not kept captive.  They live in their natural habitat and have free access to the open sea should they choose to leave.  Human intervention in their lifestyle is minimized solely to the prevention of endangerment to their existence."));
